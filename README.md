# NNDL
numpy based deep learning code development w.r.t. NNDL book by Michael Nielsen

This repository will contain all the jupyter notebooks having codes developed through the book Neural Networks and deep learning.
We will develop all the codes in numpy , based upon equations from first principle and train on MNIST dataset to study impact of various aspect of deep learning
